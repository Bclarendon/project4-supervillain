  <div class="textbox1"><p> Neuros' one true weakness is lack of power. All of his abilities are based in technology therefore areas where his A.I. is unable to spread or has no power effectively renders Neuros useless.
    <p> A truer irony is that two great weaknesses of his are enemy hackers and viruses. Harkening back to his origin, Neuros is in contstant battle with hacker groups, rogue A.I. and viruses trying to disable his network. Maybe one day they will show Neuros the error of his ways or eventually succumb to his cause.
