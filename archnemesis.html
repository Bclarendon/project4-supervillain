  <div class="textbox1"><p> Neuros' arch nemesis is Helix. A mysterious vigilante bent on shutting down Neuros' control of Neuron. The true identity of helix is unknown and it is not confirmed whether they are a real person or a robot A.I. It would appear they share similar abilities and therefore engage in many confrontations both in cyberspace and at Neuron Headquarters.
    <p> Despite their unknown identity, Helix has gained a popular underground following as they try to reveal the true identity of Neuron and Neuros' evil plan.
